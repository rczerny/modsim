HPP Lattice-Gas Cellular Automata

Lattice gas cellular automata are a type of cellular automaton used to simulate fluid flows.

As a cellular automaton, these models comprise a lattice, where the sites on the lattice can take a 
certain number of different states. In lattice gas, the various states are particles with certain 
velocities. Evolution of the simulation is done in discrete time steps. After each time step, the state 
at a given site can be determined by the state of the site itself and neighbouring sites, before the 
time step.
The state at each site is purely boolean. At a given site, there either is or is not a particle moving 
in each direction.

HPP model is a two-dimensional model of fluid particle interactions. In this model, the lattice is 
square, and the particles travel independently at a unit speed to the discrete time. The particles can 
move to any of the four sites whose cells share a common edge. Particles cannot move diagonally.
If two particles collide head-on, for example a particle moving to the left meets a particle moving to 
the right, the outcome will be two particles leaving the site at right angles to the direction they came 
in.
